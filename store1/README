This solution have emerged using coarse-grained functional tests.
It has not been elaborated to provide "daemon" behavior continuosly 
trying to scan a barcode.

Here is the problem description. 

I'm opening a new store on Monday, and I need a point-of-sale system.
My nephew promised to build one for me for low cost, and he spent 3
months on it, but he doesn't have anything working, and so I need
something working soon! I know that, at the minimum, I need one simple
feature to work:

I have a barcode scanner (like this one http://link.jbrains.ca/pXMfln)
and an LCD display (like this one http://link.jbrains.ca/mU6UX9). When
I scan a product's barcode, I want to see the price of that product on
the display. For now, you can just display the price on the screen of
a laptop, and we'll connect that to the LCD display later.

If I scan a product, and we don't know the price, display "No price
found for 273612", where "273612" is the barcode I scanned.

Try this exercise with strict test-driven development and paying
attention to the four elements of simple design:

If you have the software to do it, try recording your work as a screencast. :)
